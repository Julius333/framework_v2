# Accordion Framework

Hello GitHub. I am a student at Fontys IMD and for our assignment we had to make a Javascript framework from scratch. This is my (second) attempt! With my framework I want to make it easy to have an 'accordion' effect with your content: you can use my framework to hide and show information on command.

## How To Install

You have to copy my CSS and JS files (they are both inside the framework folder). Lastly you need to copy my HTML template which can be found in demo.html
The HTML template:

```
<div class="accordionWrapper">
    <div class="accordionItem open">
        <h2 class="accordionItemHeading">Mijn Framework</h2>        
          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <p>Met een 'accordeon' effect kan je content uitklappen</p>
            <p>Je kan gemakkelijk content verdelen in verschillende paragrafen om overzichtelijkheid te behouden.</p>
          </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Compatibility

The code is compatible with every browser I tested on a Macbook Pro 15 inch (Chrome, Safari, Mozilla and Opera)


## Demo

A Demo can be seen on my portfolio:
