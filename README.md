## Accordion Framework

Hello GitHub. I am a student at Fontys IMD and for our assignment we had to make a Javascript framework from scratch. This is my (second) attempt! With my framework I want to make it easy to have an 'accordion' effect with your content: you can use my framework to hide and show information on command.

## How To Install

You have to copy my CSS and JS files (they are both inside the framework folder). Lastly you need to copy my HTML template which can be found in demo.html

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
